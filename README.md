## Abstract
<b>Introduction</b>: Neuromusculoskeletal models provide a non-invasive mechanism for studying human movement. However, the reliability of biomechanical data computed between simulation and motion capture software is paramount in relying on and interpreting output data during motion. [1].
<b>Purpose</b>: To compare the inverse and direct approaches to quantify knee and hip angles and moments during a task with a high range of motion.
<b>Methods</b>: Ten male subjects performed five deep squat trials without previous lower limb injuries. The three-dimensional motion capture system included ten infrared cameras at 200 Hz (MX-13, Vicon) that tracked 45 full-body marker trajectories and two force plates (1000 Hz, Bertec). The data were labelled and filtered (zero-lag, 6Hz fourth-order Butterworth) using Nexus 2.6.1 (Vicon). The squat analyses were performed on the full squat cycle and processed. According to the University of Ottawa Motion Analysis Model (UOMAM), the direct approach was also processed in Nexus. The inverse method was processed in OpenSim, where the marker trajectories and GRF dataset were prepared to the specific file format. The generic squat model was scaled based on each participant's static anthropometric dimensions. Inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics tools were used to compute joint angles and net joint moments [2]. The hip was analyzed on sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes, and the knee was analyzed on the sagittal plane. The degree of agreement between the two methods was assessed with Bland and Altman, a statistical technique that plots means versus differences in measurements. The measurements agree if the means dispersion is within the 95% confidence limit.
<b>Results</b>: Bland-Altman plots applied to the peak joint angles or moments showed only partial agreement between inverse and direct approaches. The kinematic peaks revealed a tendency to measure higher knee flexion angles in Nexus than in OpenSim (133±21deg and 128±18deg, respectively), while the opposite happened for the hip flexion where the Nexus showed low values (106±7deg and 128±8deg, respectively). On the other hand, the kinetic peak analyses showed good agreement between the methods in the sagittal plane for the knee and hip joints and the transverse plane of the hip. However, there is a tendency for higher hip abduction in the OpenSim method (Nexus: -0.09±.11, OpenSim: 0.12±0.08) 
<b>Conclusion</b>: Bland-Altman plots applied to the peak joint angles showed poor agreement regarding sagittal and transverse planes. At the same time, the tests used for the typical peak moments showed good understanding, with its worst deal being on hip frontal moments.
